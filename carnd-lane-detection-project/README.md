### What is this repository for? ###

* Detecting Lane Lines in an image or video of a Road using OpenCV

* The goal of this project is to try the basic techniques of Computer Vision and develop a pipeline for the detection of lane lines on a road

* I have first tried the methods on individual images and then applied the pipeline over all the frmaes of a video to see how it would look like in real life

### Necessary dependencies ###

* Must have Anaconda for Python 3.5 installed
* OpenCV - Use `conda install -c https://conda.anaconda.org/menpo opencv3`

### Main File with the pipeline
Lane_Detection.ipynb

### Future Work ###

* The results seem to be satisfactory.
* The challenge video is still waiting to be accommodated. For that video a technique other than converting to gray-scale has to be used.
