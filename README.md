# Computer Vision and Deep Learning Projects for Autonomous Vehicles

This repository contains a collection of projects that I did to further cement my knowledge of Computer Vision, Deep Learning and Convolutional Neural Networks. 

All the projects can find applications in the domain of Self Driving Vehicles. The topics include:
 - Lane Detection
 - Traffic Sign Classification
 - Sterring Angle Prediction
 - Vehicle Detection
